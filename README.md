# Pong-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using the Turtle graphics library in Python.

# Gameplay
The game starts with a ball at the center of the screen and two paddles, one on the left and one on the right.
The user can control the paddles using the 'w' and 's' keys for the left paddle and the 'Up' and 'Down' keys for the right paddle.
The goal is to hit the ball with the paddle and make it bounce back to the other side.
Each time the ball hits the paddle, it increases in speed.
If the ball hits the wall, it bounces back.
If the ball hits the paddle, it bounces back and increases in speed.
If the ball misses the paddle, the other player scores a point.
The game keeps track of the score and displays it on the screen.

# Code Organization
The code is organized into four files:
main.py: The main game loop and event handling.
ball.py: The Ball class, which represents the ball and its movements.
paddle.py: The Paddle class, which represents the paddles and their movements.
scoreboard.py: The Scoreboard class, which displays the score.

# Features
User input for controlling the paddles
Ball movement and collision detection
Scorekeeping and display
Simple and easy to understand code

# Run the Game
To run the game, simply execute the main.py script. The Turtle graphics window will appear, and you can start playing!
